# Team Data Aggregation Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The dashboard was showing incorrect AI assistance percentages for teams due to a **double-counting bug**. Specifically:

### Root Cause
Contributors like `carloslizama17` appear in multiple teams (`Fulfillment` and `qa-automation-team`), and their commits were being counted multiple times - once for each team they belong to.

### Data Example
The same commit SHA (`00ba127948c2d9678e0efb62c27fc49ab8733702`) appeared with different AI assistance values:
- **Fulfillment team**: 231 CodeLines, 0 AILines (0.0%)
- **qa-automation-team**: 231 CodeLines, 15 AILines (6.5%)

This caused:
1. **Double-counting**: The same commit was included in both teams' totals
2. **Incorrect AI percentages**: Teams showed inflated or deflated AI assistance rates
3. **Data inconsistency**: Same commit had different AI values across teams

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Team Aggregation Logic
Modified `calculateSummaryStats()`, `renderAITeamsChart()`, `renderAIContributorsChart()`, and `renderAIReposChart()` functions to:

- **Deduplicate commits** using a unique key: `${Contributor}_${CommitSHA}_${Repository}`
- **Take maximum AI assistance**: When the same commit appears in multiple teams with different AI values, keep the one with higher AI assistance
- **Aggregate correctly**: Only count each unique commit once across all teams

### 2. Key Changes Made

#### In `calculateSummaryStats()`:
```javascript
// Before: Simple aggregation (double-counting)
stats.totalCodeLines = data.reduce((sum, row) => sum + (parseInt(row.CodeLines) || 0), 0);

// After: Deduplication with max AI selection
const uniqueCommits = new Map();
data.forEach(row => {
    const commitKey = `${row.Contributor}_${row.CommitSHA}_${row.Repository}`;
    const codeLines = parseInt(row.CodeLines) || 0;
    const aiLines = parseInt(row.AILines) || 0;
    
    // Keep commit with higher AI assistance
    if (!uniqueCommits.has(commitKey) || (uniqueCommits.get(commitKey).aiLines < aiLines)) {
        uniqueCommits.set(commitKey, { codeLines, aiLines, /* ... */ });
    }
});
```

#### In Chart Functions:
- **AI Teams Chart**: Now uses `dailyBatches` data instead of `timeSeries` for proper field access
- **AI Contributors Chart**: Implements same deduplication logic
- **AI Repositories Chart**: Implements same deduplication logic

### 3. Data Source Correction
Fixed chart rendering logic to use the correct data source:
- Changed AI Teams chart from `timeSeries` to `dailyBatches` data
- Updated rendering conditions to check for `hasDailyBatchData` instead of `hasTimeSeriesData`

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests Created
- `dashboard-team-aggregation.test.js` with comprehensive test cases:
  - Basic deduplication validation
  - Different AI values handling
  - Contributor multi-team membership detection
  - AI percentage calculation accuracy
  - Real data validation against CSV file

### Expected Results
With the fix, carloslizama17's commits should be:
- **Attributed to the team with higher AI assistance** (qa-automation-team: 6.5% vs Fulfillment: 0.0%)
- **Counted only once** across all teams
- **Teams show correct AI percentages** without double-counting inflation

## Validation
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ No syntax errors in dashboard
- ✅ Charts render with correct data sources
- ✅ Real CSV data confirms the duplicate commit issue exists
- ✅ Dashboard loads without errors

## Impact
This fix ensures:
1. **Accurate team metrics**: Teams show true AI assistance percentages
2. **No double-counting**: Each commit is counted exactly once
3. **Consistent data**: Same commit has same values across all views
4. **Better insights**: Teams can make decisions based on accurate AI adoption data

The fix addresses the fundamental data integrity issue while maintaining backward compatibility with existing data structures.
